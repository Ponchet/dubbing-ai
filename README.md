# Dubbing AI

Project for dubbing a video with many different voices with the power of the AI.

Install the requirements and get the API tokens from [AssemblyAI](https://app.assemblyai.com/) and [ApiAudio](https://www.api.audio/).
Put them in the [config.py](./config.py) and you are ready to go!

```bash
 python main.py -h
```

To see the possible options. 

At the end of the process, you will find an .mp3 file, which is the dub of the file.
